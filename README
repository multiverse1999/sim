sim is a simple, interactive, multi-file text editor designed for screens with
monospaced font. It is heavily inspired on the 'vim' and 'sam' text editors,
hence the name sim.

Requirements
------------
In order to compile this version of sim, you will need:
	- a C89 compliant C library and compiler.
	- a POSIX.1-2001 compliant system (for the termios.h functions).
	- a system that supports the ioctl TIOCGWINSZ request, for querying the
	terminal's window size.

I tried to make sim more portable by depending only on the VT100 escape
sequences for terminal size handling. But honestly it was just a pain in the
ass. If I can make it work without any issues, I'll make sure to upstream it.

In order to *use* sim, you'll need a terminal capable of handling the VT100
escape sequences.

sim has been successfully compiled and run on Linux using both musl and glibc.

sim is expected to work without any changes on other Unix-based OSes and C
libraries . If it doesn't, please let me know and I'll make it work.

Building
---------
make
or
cc *.c

Installation
------------
Just copy sim to somewhere on your PATH.

Hacking
-------
sim is designed to be extremely flexible. Every keystroke is customizable.
The core system relies on a simple table where you can map a key to a
function and (optionally) give it an argument, which allows for a very
creative usage of keys.

Adding new features to sim is a breeze. Honestly, sometimes not even I
believe how easy it is. Just create a function that does what you want, map
it to a sane key on your config file, and compile it. *It just works*.

config.def.h is the default key config file. You're supposed to copy it to
config.h and edit it there, so that you do not lose your changes when a new
patch comes out.

sim also makes patches made by other people available at the project's site.

In order to apply a patch, just use the patch command.

Commands
--------
Although all commands are customizable, sim comes by default with vim-based
keymaps (without, of course losing sim's charmful differences):
